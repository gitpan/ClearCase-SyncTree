This is a program/module for bringing a set of files under ClearCase
control by making the minimal set of required changes and running the
minimal set of cleartool operations. The real code is in the module,
but a wrapper script 'synctree' is provided for command-line access.
For those familar with 'citree', consider this a version of citree that
works on both UNIX and Windows NT (citree is UNIX-only).

The most common use for SyncTree is probably in moving the results of a
build from their build locations to a staging area or release VOB while
preserving CR's and potentially changing names/paths en route.  That's
the purpose it was originally designed for.

As of ClearCase 4.1 there's a new 'clearfsimport' tool which will have
the effect of obsoleting citree and many uses of synctree. However,
there remain some cases where synctree may be preferable; for instance
it (1) works with versions prior to 4.1, (2) handles MVFS->MVFS
transfers while preserving CR's whereas clearfsimport does
flat_file_system->MVFS only, (3) has support for mapping filenames in
transit and a -Narrow option for limiting the set of files to transfer,
and (4) provides an API (ClearCase::SyncTree) for custom tool
development in Perl whereas clearfsimport is a command-line interface
only. But in most cases the supported, integrated solution is to be
preferred and clearfsimport has advantages over synctree which aren't
discussed here (at the least it's somewhat faster though neither could
be described as quick).

Note: newer versions of ClearCase::SyncTree may be present at
