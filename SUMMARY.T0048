This is a program/module for bringing a set of files under ClearCase
control by making the minimal set of required changes and running the
minimal set of cleartool operations. The real code is in the module,
but a wrapper script 'synctree' is provided for command-line access.
For those familar with 'citree', consider this a version of citree that
works on both UNIX and Windows NT (citree is UNIX-only).  Note: newer
versions may be present at
