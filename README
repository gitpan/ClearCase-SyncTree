			WHAT IT IS

This is a program/module for bringing a set of files under ClearCase
control by making the minimal set of required changes and running the
minimal set of cleartool operations. The real code is in the module,
but a wrapper script 'synctree' is provided for command- line access.
Full documentation for both is provided as inline POD format.

			PROVENANCE

ClearCase::SyncTree is a distant descendant of Paul Smith's 'citree'
program, which in turn is a distant descendant of a sample script by
the same name provided with ClearCase. Though it bears no resemblance
to Paul's any more, I retain his copyright since mine did mutate from
his.

			PLATFORM NOTE

This package is believed to work on all ClearCase platforms including
Windows. Note, however, that while the _module_ has significant Windows
testing, the synctree wrapper script does not as I don't use it there.
It does appear to work just fine in limited Windows testing, though.
