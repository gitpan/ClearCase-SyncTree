<H1><A NAME="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</A></H1>
<PRE>
  synctree -sbase /tmp/newcode -dbase /vobs_tps/xxx</PRE>
<P>Take all files located under /tmp/newcode/xxx, remove the leading
``/tmp/newcode'', from each of their pathnames, and place the remaining
relative paths under ``/vobs_tps/xxx''.</P>
<PRE>
  synctree -cr -yes -sbase /vobs/hpux/bin -dbase /vobs_rel/hpux/bin</PRE>
<P>Sync all files under ``/vobs_rel/hpux/bin'' with those in
``/vobs/hpux/bin'', making sure to preserve their CR's. Suppress
interactive prompting.</P>
<PRE>
  synctree -sb /A/B -db /X/Y -map /A/B/foo /X/Y/bar /A/B/here /X/Y/there</PRE>
<P>Take 'foo' from directory /A/B and check it in as 'bar' in /X/Y.
Similarly for 'here' and 'there'.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="description">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
<P>Synctree brings a VOB area into alignment with a specified set of files
from a source area. It's analogous in various ways to <EM>clearfsimport</EM>,
<EM>citree</EM>, and <EM>clearexport/clearimport</EM>; see the COMPARISONS section
below.  Synctree is useful if you have a ClearCase tree that must be
kept in sync with a CVS tree during a transition period, or for
overlaying releases of third-party products upon previous ones, or
exporting deliverable DO's from a nightly build to a release VOB while
preserving CR's and labels, or similar.</P>
<P>The default operation is to mkelem all files which exist in
<EM>&lt;src&gt;</EM> but not in <EM>&lt;dest&gt;</EM>, modify any files which
exist in both but differ, but <STRONG>not</STRONG> to remove files which are present
in <EM>&lt;dest&gt;</EM> and not in <EM>&lt;src&gt;</EM>.  The <EM>-rmname</EM> flag
will cause this removal to happen as well.</P>
<P>Synctree need not run in a view context but the directory named by the
<EM>-dbase</EM> flag must provide a view context. The branching behavior of
any checkouts performed will be governed by that view's config spec.
The <EM>-dbase</EM> directory need not exist, as long as it lies under a
mounted VOB tag and in a view context. In other words, synctree can
auto-create the destination directory tree.</P>
<P>The list of source files to operate on may be provided with the
<EM>-flist</EM> option or it may come from <CODE>@ARGV</CODE>. Any directories
encountered on <CODE>@ARGV</CODE> will be traversed recursively. If no
source-file-list is provided, the directory specified with <EM>-sbase</EM> is
used as the default.</P>
<P>File paths may be given as relative or absolute. Destination paths are
determined as follows: all source filenames are first turned into
absolute paths if necessary, then the path given with the <EM>-sbase</EM>
parameter is removed and replaced with that of <EM>-dbase</EM> to produce the
destination pathname (but see FILE MAPPING below).</P>
<P>Symbolic links are supported, even on Windows.  Note that the text of
the link is transported <EM>verbatim</EM> from source area to dest area; thus
relative symlinks may no longer resolve in the destination area.</P>
<P>Consider using the <EM>-n</EM> flag the first time you use this on a valued
VOB, even though nothing irreversible is done (e.g.  no <EM>rmelem</EM>,
<EM>rmbranch</EM>, <EM>rmver</EM>, <EM>rmtype</EM>, etc.).  And by the same token use
<EM>-ci</EM> and <EM>-yes</EM> with care.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="options">OPTIONS</A></H1>
<P>Not all options are described here, only those requiring elaboration
beyond the <CODE>-help</CODE> summary. Run <CODE>synctree -help</CODE> for a full option
summary.</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2Dforce%2C_%2Dstop"><EM>-force, -stop</EM></A></STRONG><BR>

By default, upon encountering a ClearCase error synctree will attempt
to return to the initial state by undoing all checkouts etc. The
<EM>-stop</EM> flag will cause it to exit immediately leaving the current
state intact, while <EM>-force</EM> will cause it to blunder onward ignoring
errors. However, even with <EM>-force</EM> a nonzero status is returned if
errors are encountered.
<P></P>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2Dno%2C_%2Dyes%2C_%2Dci"><EM>-no, -yes, -ci</EM></A></STRONG><BR>

The <EM>-no</EM> flag causes synctree to report what it would do and exit
without making any changes, <EM>-yes</EM> suppresses all prompts, and <EM>-ci</EM>
makes it check in all changes without asking.
<P></P>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2Dlabel%2C_%2Dlbmods"><EM>-label, -lbmods</EM></A></STRONG><BR>

The <EM>-label</EM> option let you specify a label to be applied before
finishing. By default it will label recursively from the <EM>-dbase</EM> area
down, as well as all parent directories upward to the vob root.
If the <EM>-lbmods</EM> flag is used in conjunction, only modified elements
will be labeled.
<P></P>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2Dreuse"><EM>-reuse</EM></A></STRONG><BR>

If element X is created in synctree run #1, rmname'd in run #2, and 
created again in run #3, you may end up with multiple elements with
the same name. This situation is known as an <EM>evil twin</EM>. The
<EM>-reuse</EM> flag can avoid this; before making a new element it
searches the directory's version tree looking for a prior element
of the same name. If found, it will line the old element back into
the current version of the directory, then (if the contents differ)
check it out and replace the contents with those of the source
file.
<P>This flag can avoid evil twins and save storage space but will run a
little slower due to the extra analysis. Also, there's no guarantee the
prior element of the same name is in fact logically related to the new
one. They could conceivably even be of different element types.</P>
<P></P>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2DNarrow"><EM>-Narrow</EM></A></STRONG><BR>

The <EM>-Narrow</EM> flag allows a regular expression to limit the files
from the source list which are compared with the destination base.
I.e. if you want to transport all the <CODE>*.class</CODE> files from a
dir tree without the source files you can use
<PRE>
    synctree -N '\.class\$' ...</PRE>
<P>Note that the argument is a Perl regular expression, not a file glob.
Any legal Perl RE may be used. Also, multiple <EM>-Narrow</EM> flags may be
used; thus, to collect <CODE>*.class</CODE> and <CODE>*.properties</CODE> files you may use
either of:</P>
<PRE>
    synctree -N '\.class\$' -N '\.properties\$' ...
    synctree -N '\.(class|properties)\$' ...</PRE>
<P>Also, the <EM>-Narrow</EM> flag is considered only for file lists derived
internally by synctree. If you provide your own file list using
<EM>-flist</EM>, filtering it is your own responsibility.</P>
<P></P></UL>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="file mapping">FILE MAPPING</A></H1>
<P>Synctree has lots of support for remapping filenames. The options can
be pretty confusing and thus deserve special treatment here.</P>
<P>Filename mapping is enabled with the <STRONG>-map</STRONG> flag.  Without
<EM>-map</EM>, a list of files provided on the command line is interpreted as
a set of <EM>from</EM> files; their <EM>to</EM> paths are derived via
<EM>s/^sbase/dbase/</EM> and thus the file basenames do not change. However,
in the presence of <EM>-map</EM> the @ARGV is instead interpreted as a hash
alternating <STRONG>from</STRONG> and <STRONG>to</STRONG> names.  Thus</P>
<PRE>
  synctree -sb /etc -db /vobs_st/etc /etc/passwd /etc/group</PRE>
<P>would make two files under /vobs_st/etc called passwd and group, whereas</P>
<PRE>
  synctree -sb /etc -db /vobs_st/etc -map /etc/passwd /vobs_st/etc/foo</PRE>
<P>would create one file (/vobs_st/etc/foo) which is a copy of /etc/passwd.
Alternatively the mapping may be specified with a literal <STRONG>=&gt;</STRONG>:</P>
<PRE>
  synctree -sb /etc -db /vobs_st/etc -map '/etc/passwd =&gt; /vobs_st/etc/foo' ...</PRE>
<P>but note that this must be quoted against shell expansion. The
<EM>=&gt;</EM> style is also allowed in files specified via <STRONG>-flist</STRONG>,
thus:</P>
<PRE>
  synctree -sb /etc -db /vobs_st/etc -flist - &lt;&lt; EOF
  /etc/passwd =&gt; /vobs_st/etc/foo
  /etc/group  =&gt; /vobs_st/etc/bar
  EOF</PRE>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="comparisons">COMPARISONS</A></H1>
<P>Synctree is comparable to <EM>citree</EM> and <EM>clearfsimport</EM>. It is similar
to citree but runs on both Windows and UNIX. It has the following
advantages over clearfsimport:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Synctree works with all ClearCase versions whereas clearfsimport is
first supported in CC 4.2.
<P></P>
<LI>
Synctree handles <CODE>MVFS-</CODE>MVFS&gt; transfers while preserving CR's whereas
clearfsimport treats the source as flat files.
<P></P>
<LI>
Synctree has support for mapping filenames in transit and a <EM>-Narrow</EM>
option for limiting the set of files to transfer.
<P></P>
<LI>
Synctree is built on a published API (<STRONG>ClearCase::SyncTree</STRONG>) which may
aid custom tool development in Perl whereas clearfsimport is a
command-line interface only.
<P></P>
<LI>
Synctree has support for <EM>element retention</EM>. I.e. if an element is
added in one pass and removed (rmnamed) in a subsequent pass, and if a
third pass would make another element of the same name, synctree can
optionally (<EM>-reuse</EM>) make a link to the existing file instead of
making a new element that may be considered an ``evil twin''.
<P></P></UL>
<P>However, unless you need one of the above features the supported,
integrated solution (<STRONG>clearfsimport</STRONG>) is generally preferable. And of
course all of these features <EM>may</EM> eventually be supported by
clearfsimport.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="bugs">BUGS</A></H1>
<UL>
<LI>
Subtraction of symlinks is currently unimplemented (it's just a corner
case I haven't gotten to).
<P></P>
<LI>
SyncTree does not transport empty directories, and added/removed
directories aren't shown explicitly in the list of operations to be
performed. This is a structural artifact.
<P></P>
<LI>
I have not tested SyncTree in snapshot views and would not expect it to
work there without modifications.
<P></P></UL>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="debugging">DEBUGGING</A></H1>
<P>The special flag <EM>-/dbg=1</EM> will cause all underlying cleartool
commands to be printed as they are run (this is actually a feature of
the Argv module on which <EM>synctree</EM> is built).</P>

<P>The guts of this program are in the ClearCase::SyncTree module, which
is known to work on Solaris 2.6-7 and Windows NT 4.0SP3-5, and with
perl 5.004_04 and 5.6. The <EM>synctree</EM> wrapper program per se has had
only rudimentary testing on Windows but appears to work fine there.</P>
