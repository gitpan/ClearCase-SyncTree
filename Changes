	- Added --Version flag to synctree.
	- Fix bug reported by Paul Faulstich of llbean.com.
	- Removed requirement for 'dbase' dir to exist a priori.
	- Only look for subtractions if requested (for performance).
	- Add support for subtraction preview.
	- Added -follow feature for alignment with clearfsimport.
	- Some peformance enhancements by combining repetitive
	  cleartool commands into one.
	- No longer requires a set view on UNIX as long as the
	  dest dir is in a view context.
	- Added a -quiet flag to synctree (requires Argv 1.00).
	- Improved -force to return an exit status.
	- Fixed synctree to return nonzero if any checkin fails.
	- Bugfix: transport non-resolving (dangling) symlinks correctly.
	- Require Argv 1.00 or above (related bugfixes there).

0.24 Fri Sep 14 14:05:40 EDT 2001
