	  -ok with -y (sense toggled), replaced -preview with -n.

	- Bugfix involving misplaced -ptime flag, caused by
	  overenthusiastic cleanup.

	  by James Anderson.

	  files it didn't create.

0.19 Sun Nov 12 21:04:17 EST 2000
	- Removed undocumented constructor param for setting comparator.
	  (use ->cmp_func instead).
	- Fixed a recently-introduced bug breaking -rm/name.
	- Added a ->reuse method to SyncTree and -reuse flag to synctree.
	  (tested exactly once on one file).

	  Windows/CC place to test right now).
